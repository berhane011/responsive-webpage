    <p>
        I've not been a â€œcomputer guy" from the very beginning. I caught this when I got my first PC. I was in 9th grade then. I learnt how to use it, and obviously struggled. There was a friend, who got better knowledge about computers, who always helped me, every problem I faced, he had a solution to that on the go. I envied him. So, he developed my interest in computers.
        I have always been equally passionate about construction and technology. When I was in middle school my grades were the highest in class.but Later, in high school, I developed an affinity for science and progressed with excellent academic scores. In my high school leaving examination, I scored great distinction, which allowed me to join the coveted Department of Civil Engineering in the Eritrea Institute of Technology.I completed my bachelors with 3.83/4.0 GPA, beside this I took the GRE exam,and scored 320,verbal reasoning 161 and quantitative reasoning 159.
         My choice of Civil Engineering for undergraduate study was based on an ambition fostered since childhood as well as my predisposition towards the physical sciences in high school. But during the course of my undergraduate education, I realized the vast and exciting nature of engineering, solving problems. Not only did I appreciate the field from a personal perspective but also from its immense relevance in my country, Eritrea, which is one of the poorest countries in the world with almost no technologies that has been battered by endless years of war and conflict.
         However, I never gave up on computer. As I grew older, I continued these parallel paths, working on design projects in university and study computer on my own like learning HTML,CSS,JavaScript and Java and python language which I enjoy the most. I never regret my decision to study civil Engineering , because it was a perfect way to exert your own creativity through projects and because of my previous knowledge about programming and its complementation to my project, becoming a successful student compared to others came pretty easily to me.
         Maybe a lot of people think that Computer Science and Civil Engineering are two different irrelevant fields of study, but they would be dazzled if they knew how these two different categories are linked together. After a while I became more attracted to computers and started to learn programming with Java and keep studying courses like algorithm and data structure on my own . With the help of these I wrote some basic programs and develop webs
         I try not to think about the past like what if I studied Computer Science 6 years ago, instead of Civil engineering. I always believe that it's never too late to mend. Being considered as a Computer scientist was my dream for many years, but I was not courageous enough to seriously think about it. Today, I am  more competent and determined, and of course enthusiastic to reach my goal.I have immense passion for becoming a data scientist. In my workplace and at home, I always strive to deepen my knowledge of software Engineering and to transform myself to become a professional in the field. I have read a number of relevant books , have taken online courses like Java, data structures and algorithm (udemy),and have constantly been browsing through the internet to find out about new breakthrough in the field. Even though, I have discovered a subject that accommodates both my interest and aptitude, I also discovered that I need a deeper knowledge which enables me to impact more and research further.
         My ultimate goal is to glean as much knowledge as I can to make a lasting contribution. And to do so I need to acquire more in-depth knowledge in data science, delve into the principle of the field through interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches with the help of your various research institute and well-equipped facilities. I believe that studying this course  will give me the opportunity to prove myself and grantee my dream job as a data scientist.
         I will be very much grateful if you give a scholar I will make maximum use of all the opportunities bestowed upon me and shall pursue my goals with wholehearted dedication and can live to the high standards set by you guys. I thank you in advance for your time and attention in reading my statement of purpose .
